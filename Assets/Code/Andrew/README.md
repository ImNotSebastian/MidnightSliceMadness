The feature that I am developing is part of the main gameplay loop. 

The main gameplay loop consists of pizza delivery where the main character will create pizza objects 
that can be picked up and dropped by the character so they can be delivered to their destination for points. 
There will be different pizza types for the pizza objects which will involve a decoration design pattern. 
I will for sure be developing the pizza request, creation, and pick-up features. 
I might also make the pizza drop off and calculate points feature depending on if Zoe needs these tasks to complete 
any code requirements she missed in developing her feature like implementing a pattern.
